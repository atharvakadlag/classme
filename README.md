The app was built as a lazy project to automate the boring task of looking up the link of the current class and joining it.  
This webapp takes you to the current class based on the data in classlinks.json. It also has pages to show links, and timetabls.

# Deploy
edit the classlinks.json file to your timetable and host it on a serivce that supports flask webapps
